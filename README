		1.    Open Form in Designer and make needed GUI changes. Close designer and save
		2.    Compile project and receive RESX compile error (only forms with Imagelist should have this problem)
		3.    Double-click resx compile error to open resx file.
		4.    Scroll to top of imagestream.
		5.    Edit the top line of the Image stream:
		AAEAAAD/////AQAAAAAAAAAMAgAAAFdTeXN0ZW0uV2luZG93cy5Gb3JtcywgVmVyc2lvbj00LjAuMC4w
		TO
		AAEAAAD/////AQAAAAAAAAAMAgAAAFdTeXN0ZW0uV2luZG93cy5Gb3JtcywgVmVyc2lvbj0yLjAuMC4w
		6.    Close and save resx file and recompile.
		**NOTE: the only difference are the characters at end "j00LjAuMC4w' to "j0yLjAuMC4w"

		This needs to be done EVERY TIME you open the form in Designer mode.
